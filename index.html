            <p id="hero">Look Back by Fujimoto</p>
            <p id="subtext">Fourth-grader Ayumu Fujino regularly draws four-panel manga for her school newspaper and is
                lauded as having the best artwork in her class. One day, she is asked by her teacher to turn over one of
                her manga slots in the school newspaper to a truant student named Kyomoto. When Kyomoto's manga pops up
                alongside Fujino's, it receives high praises for its detailed artwork, making Fujino furiously jealous.
                Refusing to be beaten by someone who barely attends school, Fujino devotes herself to learning to create
                manga. As time goes on though, her goal of outshining Kyomoto seems to only get further and further
                away, and Fujino, now in sixth grade, eventually gives up and quits making manga.
                Graduation day arrives, and Fujino is asked to deliver Kyomoto's graduation certificate to her. Through
                chance, the two end up coming face to face, and their unexpected meeting will end up having consequences
                far beyond what either of them could ever predict.</p>

            <q id="quote">With the monumental success of Tatsuki Fujimoto's Chainsaw Man it is no wonder that studios
                immediately
                turned to adapting more of his works. The concern of course then becomes whether there will be a rush to
                pump something out regardless of the quality. Thankfully, much like Chainsaw Man, Studio Durian was able
                to uphold and even uplift Fujimoto's Look Back and, in the process, create a beautiful, heartfelt and
                devastating movie that will surely leave an impact for years to come.
